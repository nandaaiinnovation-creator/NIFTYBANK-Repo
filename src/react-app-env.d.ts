// FIX: Removed `/// <reference types="react-scripts" />`
// This reference is specific to Create React App and causes a compilation error
// if `react-scripts` is not a project dependency. Since the project doesn't
// appear to use asset imports that rely on these specific types, removing
// the reference is the safest way to resolve the error.
